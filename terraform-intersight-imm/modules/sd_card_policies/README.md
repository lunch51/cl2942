# sd_card_policies - Intersight SD Card Policy Terraform Module

## Usage

```hcl
module "sd_card_policy" {

  source = "terraform-cisco-modules/imm/intersight//modules/sd_card_policies"

  # omitted...
}
```

This module will create a Storage SD Card Policy in Intersight.  This can be used to create Profiles and Templates that require a Storage SD Card Policy.
